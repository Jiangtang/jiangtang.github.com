      <description>The concept of current working directory in SAS is not as important as it sounds. Most SAS users point to file reference (fileref) and library reference (libname, a “namespace”-like mechanism to access files ), which are much convenient in large project with multiple folders.

 filename CDISC url “https://raw.github.com/Jiangtang/Programming-SAS/master/Rules_Count_OpenCDISC_XML.sas”;
%include CDISC;
%Rules_Count_OpenCDISC_XML(dir=C:tempOpenCDISCsoftwareopencdisc-validatorconfig)
