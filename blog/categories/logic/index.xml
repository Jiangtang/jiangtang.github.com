      <title>Frequentist or Baysian in A Binomial Test</title>

      <description>A latest updated post on Freakonomics, Beware the Weasel Word “Statistical” in Statistical Significance!,&amp;#160; seemed to attempt to challenge frequentist statistics by Bayesian. I have no research on Bayesian and won’t jump to the debates. I’d rather to use this case to apply the Dragon’s Teeth and Fleas logic of hypothesis testing (at least I think frequentist is pretty intuitive). 
A story goes with this post, that Bob won 20 times out of total 30 rounds with Alice in a children card game, “War”.</description>

      <description>Statisticians aren’t the problem for data science. The real problem is too many posers &amp;#8212; Cathy O’Neil
you actually do need to understand how to invert a matrix at some point in your life if you want to be a data scientist. &amp;#8212; Cathy O’Neil
 
I was asked in several different occasions to explain hypothesis testing to non-technical people in plain English. Now I think I got a pretty neat one while honors belong to three great Germans, Friedrich Engels, Karl Marx, and Heinrich Heine.</description>

&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &amp;#8211;by L. Peter Deutsch, creator of Ghostscript. (I also love his saying “_The best thing about a Boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit_”)
 I learned this quote from Tony Barr, designer and developer of SAS (the Statistical Analysis System).&amp;#160; He also used the Recursive Descent method to develop SAS complier. Now Tony is working for AMOR (A Model of Reality).</description>

      <description>To understand recursion, one of the most important concepts in programming languages, you could watch the movie, Chris Nolan’s Inception: it is about a dream within a dream within a dream, …and, read two statistical papers by Professor Robert Newcombe, one of the most prolific statisticians:
 Two-sided confidence intervals for the single proportion: comparison of seven methods.

      <description>Refresh some basic logical propositions (or statements):
 implication:&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; if&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; P then&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Q (P—&amp;gt;Q)
inverse:&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; if not P then not Q (-P—&amp;gt;-Q)
converse:&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; if&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Q then&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; P (Q—&amp;gt;P)
contrapositive: if not Q then not P (-Q—&amp;gt;-P)
contradition:&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; if&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; P then not Q (P—&amp;gt;-Q)
 Mathematically or logically speaking, if the implication statement holds, then the contrapositive holds, but the inverse does not hold, i.e., if P then Q, then we can get if not Q then not P, but we can not get if not P then not Q.</description>
