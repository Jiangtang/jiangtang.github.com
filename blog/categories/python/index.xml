      <description>2016 was gone, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t even leave one single blog post. An obvious inference should be, 2016 doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist&amp;hellip;
2016 was a year of struggle for me as a SAS programmer. I earn my bread mostly using SAS, but is a SAS programmer like me cool? It&amp;rsquo;s not a silly question. Lots of SAS programmers feel the crunch.
So, in 2016, I
 learned some Python, attended Pydata Carolinas, learned some Spark, and got certified by edX somehow with all the bubble words in the title, Distributed Machine Learning with Apache Spark, learned some math, Linear Algebra, learned more math, Probability, learned even more math, Numerical Analysis, and didn&amp;rsquo;t update one single blog post, because all my spare time and coffee making time were simply run out.</description>
