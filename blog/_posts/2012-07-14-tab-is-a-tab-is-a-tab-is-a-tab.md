Well I’m a big fan of “tabs” and feel much more comfortable when launching everything into tabs: web pages, text files, PDF files, Windows Office files (Word, Excel, PPT), and even folders.  Followings are my best of choices to share:

# 1. File Explorer: Clover

There are lots of fancy/complicated file/folder management system beyond Windows Explore ([Total Commander][2] might be the most famous one) while Clover, as its name indicates, is just as simple as I need:

*   Ctrl+T: open new tab
*   Ctrl+W: close tab
*   Ctr+tab: switch among tabs

And these shortcuts also work at the following applications (so, nothing new need to learn).

# 2. Web Browser: Chrome

> <https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/>

While IE, as a saying goes, is a best browser to download Chrome(or [Firefox][4] if you like).

# 3. PDF Reader: Foxit Reader

Get rid of [Adobe Reader][7]. Foxit Reader is no doubt the best of best PDF reader as it shows (and it’s free). 

# 4. Office Suite: Office Tab

Office Tab is a Microsoft Office add-in and it works (to launch Word, Excel and PPT files to tabs)!

# 5. Text Editor: Notepad++/Sublime Text 2

[I use Notepad++][11] for a long time and love it, but when I [take a look at Sublime Text 2][12], I should admit that it has much of potentials to serve as my default text editor in the future:
