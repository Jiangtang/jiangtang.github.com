Poem from R&D staff?  
Yes. Rhyming sonnets were shakespeare-like complex;  
they wrote Japanese haiku, showed as above.

The SAS R&D staff should complete some paper work in defects system before changing a code. They use informal descriptive language(HAIKUUU!) in the early stage. [Chris Hemedinger][1], a senior software engineer at SAS, collected some [haikus][2] in his blog to show the humor side of SAS R&D staff. It’s interesting to cite one of the most famous haikus by [Matsuo Bashō][3] for comparison:

> Old pond  
> a frog jumps  
> the sound of water
