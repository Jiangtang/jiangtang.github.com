The SAS Global Forum 2011 (Apr 4-7, Las Vegas) papers are now available on line:

<http://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings11/TOC.html>

There are lots of Web 2.0 elements in this year’s SGF, including a Twitter hashtag [#SASGF11][1], [a Facebook account][2], [a blog][3], [a LinkedIn group][4], and of course, <sasCommunity.org>. I will give a talk at this conference ([Tuesday, April 5, 05:30- 05:50 PM, Promenade Level, Neopolitan IV][5]) to discuss how to get informed with little efforts from such multiple channels for SAS programmers using Gmail and Good Reader to create a personal information portal. That is part of my first SAS paper, *[Work Smarter Rather than Harder- Tools for Growing up A SAS® Programmer][6].*

It will also be my first presence in SGF. Just can’t wait to walk with SAS masters there!
