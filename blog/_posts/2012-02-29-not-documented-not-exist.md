Weeks before I first got the [column edit mode in SAS 9.3 Enhanced Editor][1]. Since had no previous SAS versions in machine, I just checked the [online documentation of SAS 9.2][2] in which it’s not mentioned (while documented in [SAS 9.3][3]) then I concluded the column mode is an exciting new feature in SAS 9.3: if it is not documented, it doesn’t exist!

Then it turns that I was wrong. My friend [Venkat Veerisetty][4] just told me that this feature was available since SAS v8. I also found a machine with SAS v9.2 and it works.

While not-documented-not-exist is obviously an arbitrary assumption regardless of facts, I still hold it somehow when emphasizing the importance of documentation.  [Chris Hemedinger][5] gave [a reason why there are some undocumented “behaviors” in SAS][6]. It makes sense, while in this case, it would be just happened to be missed in other documents and then newly added in v9.3.
