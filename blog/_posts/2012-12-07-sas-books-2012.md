![SAS_Books][1]

Last year I threw away all my SAS books (to friends and colleagues in Beijing) before moving to US. You might agree that it’s not economically bound to transport such heavy books intercontinentally! Now I just start to build my SAS library one by one. 

I will most probably not buy more SAS books as Christmas gifts for myself, so it’s time to take a 2012 snapshot of shopping:

##### I Programming Books by Art Carpenter 

1 *[Carpenter’s Complete Guide to the SAS Macro Language, 2nd Edition][2], 2004*

Best of best on SAS (dynamic) programming. I also had a hardcopy in Beijing. ★★★★★

2* *[*Carpenter’s Guide to Innovative SAS Techniques*][3], 2012

It’s new by Carpenter and nice to check out. 

3 [*Carpenter’s Complete Guide to the SAS REPORT Procedure*][4], 2007 

Use [Proc Report][5]! It is the workhorse procedure for SAS report writing and [Proc Tabulate][6] is not in fashion anymore! 
Btw, The historically called SAS DATA \_NULL\_ report writing now has a brand new name, ODS Report Writing Interface, due to the incorporated ODS facility(which is cool). I think it deserves a new title.

PS: I got it free from the latest [RTSUG][7] (Research Triangle SAS Users’ Group) meeting. 

##### II Programming Miscellaneous

4 [*Web Development with SAS by Example*, Third Edition][8] by Frederick Pratter, 2011

Want to play HTML/htmSQL/AJAX/Javascript… within SAS. no comments by far.

5  [*SAS Hash Object Programming Made Easy*][9] by Michele Burlew, 2012

Totally new title on this topic. Nice to approach to the new area.

##### III ODS Graphics

6 [*Statistical Graphics Procedures by Example: Effective Graphs Using SAS*][10] by Sanjay Matange and Dan Heath, 2011

SAS ODS Graphics is the rising Star! I also read other title on ODS statistical graphics in Beijing, 

[*Statistical Graphics in SAS: An Introduction to the Graph Template Language and the Statistical Graphics Procedures*][11] by Warren Kuhfeld

You may read plenty of ODS Graphics  papers by these authors/developers from SAS Institute.

##### IV Statistical Books

7 [*Common Statistical Methods for Clinical Research with SAS Examples*, Third Edition][12] by Glenn Walker, Jack Shostak, 2010

Best for SAS clinical programmers. Relevant, comprehensive and easy to access. I had a second version in Beijing. ★★★★★

*8 [Multiple Comparisons and Multiple Tests Using SAS, Second Edition][13] by *Peter H. Westfall, Randall D. Tobias, Russell D. Wolfinger, 2011

Multiple comparison is an advanced topic and is beyond my limited statistical knowledge. My short term goal is just to follow the codes then interprete results.

##### V CDISC

9 [*Implementing CDISC Using SAS: An End-to-End Guide*][14] by Chris Holland and Jack Shostak, 2012

Still on the way. The first title on CDISC + SAS and worth of waiting. I read Jack Shostak’s another book when applying a SAS programmer job at Sanofi Pasteur Beijing R&D in 2009:

> [*SAS Programming in the Pharmaceutical Industry*][15]

##### VI My Wish List 2013

10 [*Building Web Applications with SAS/IntrNet: A Guide to the Application Dispatcher*][16] by Don Henderson

SAS web programming again. I might read this title before #4. Don Henderson was the former SAS developer and SAS/IntrNet was just his baby!

11 [*Categorical Data Analysis Using SAS, Third Edition*][17] by Maura Stokes, Charles Davis, and Gary Koch

I had a second version hardcopy in Beijing and it’s still cool to play with 2*2 table in this so called BIG DATA world! ★★★★★

12 [*Cody’s Collection of Popular SAS Programming Tasks and How to Tackle Them*][18] by Ron Cody

I read and like [Cody’s book on SAS functions][19] and it’s always nice to check out his new title.

13 [*The Global English Style Guide: Writing Clear, Translatable Documentation for a Global Market*][20] by John R. Kohl

I read the free chapter and it would be good book to polish my English as a technical blog writer.

14 [*The Little SAS Book: A Primer, Fifth Edition*][21] by Lora Delwiche and Susan Slaughter

I forget the version I read back to the time I first approached to SAS and it’s nice to hold a latest version in shelf and I’d rather learn the effective writing! Best for beginners. ★★★★★
