This blog, “[From A Logical Point of View][2]”, is not supposed to be owned by a logician. Actually, the book, *[From A Logical Point of View][3]*, is a collection of logical and philosophical essays by [W.V.Quine][4](1908-2000), an American philosopher and mathematician. 

A story about this book. *[From A Logical Point of View][5]*, was a calypso song by [Robert Mitchum][6], an US actor, composer and singer. Quine enjoyed this music and used it as his new book, which is Quine’s best seller. Now I love this book and give the name to my blog from a logical point of view^.
