<span style="font-size: small;">This blog, “<a href="http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/">From A Logical Point of View</a>”, is not supposed to be owned by a logician. Actually, the book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logical-Point-View-Logico-Philosophical-Revised/dp/0674323513">From A Logical Point of View</a></em>, is a collection of logical and philosophical essays by <a href="http://www.wvquine.org/">W.V.Quine</a>(1908-2000), an American philosopher and mathematician. </span>

<span style="font-size: small;">A story about this book. <em><a href="http://www.gugalyrics.com/ROBERT-MITCHUM-FROM-A-LOGICAL-POINT-OF-VIEW-LYRICS/411924/">From A Logical Point of View</a></em>, was a calypso song by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mitchum">Robert Mitchum</a>, an US actor, composer and singer. Quine enjoyed this music and used it as his new book, which is Quine’s best seller. Now I love this book and give the name to my blog from a logical point of view^.</span>
