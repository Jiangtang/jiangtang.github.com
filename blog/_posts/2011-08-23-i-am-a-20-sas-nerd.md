[Kirk Paul Lafler][1] drafted a checking list for identifying a SAS nerd (or geek, in its positive ways) in one of his intriguing papers:

> *[You Could be a SAS® Nerd If . . .][2]* 

Here I’m glad to find that I am roughly a 20% SAS nerd (12 matched in all 57 lists):

> 8. You blog SAS-related comments and technical solutions frequently. 
> 
> 9. You have more than five SAS blogs in your RSS feed. 
> 
> 10. Your home page is support.sas.com, sasCommunity.org, SAS-L, or LexJansen.com. 
> 
> 11. You know more than ten SAS keyboard shortcuts. 
> 
> 12. You get excited when you find a new match-merge technique that performs better than the one you developed the week before.
> 
> 21. You have more than one version of SAS on your machine or network so you can compare and contrast program, processing and output differences.
> 
> 28. You spend your Friday evenings and weekends responding to SAS-L posts, entering sasCommunity blog entries, and reading the latest “hot” SAS topic on LexJansen.com.
> 
> 38. The first thing you read in the morning is the “Tip of the Day”.
> 
> 45. You subscribe to five or more SAS groups on LinkedIn, sasCommunity, and Facebook and you use a tabbed browser so you can be online with all of them at the same time.
> 
> 47. You spend your evenings and weekends SAS-L’ing, Googling and Binging looking for elegant SAS technical solutions.
> 
> 50. You proudly proclaim that you’re a SAS programmer when asked by a fellow passenger, “What do you do for a living?”
> 
> 51. You’re amazed when your fellow airline passenger replies, “What is a “SAS programmer?”.

I also asked Kirk if he is a 100% SAS nerd and Kirk replied, NO. He said he is a 99% SAS nerd:)
