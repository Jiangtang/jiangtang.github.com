Almost at the same time, there are two SAS blogs aggregators popping up to the web for SAS programmers worldwide, one in Chinese, the other, English:

> <http://saslist.com/>&#160; in Chinese, maintained by [sxlion](http://saslist.com/sxlion/), also the owner of a SAS information site,&#160; <http://saslist.net/>
> 
> <http://sas-x.com/>&#160;&#160; in English, maintained by [Tal Galili](http://www.r-statistics.com/), also the owner of R blogs aggregator, <http://r-bloggers.com/>

I try to express in a very symmetrical way. Whatâ€™s more (and interesting), these two aggregators share a same WordPress template. My blogs, [in Chinese](http://jiangtanghu.com/cn) and [in English](http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog), are also the members of these aggregators respectively. 

I view this is the first wave for SAS programmers to embrace the Web2.0 world. If interested, you could also add your SAS blogs in
