Almost at the same time, there are two SAS blogs aggregators popping up to the web for SAS programmers worldwide, one in Chinese, the other, English:

> <http://saslist.com/>  in Chinese, maintained by [sxlion][1], also the owner of a SAS information site,  <http://saslist.net/>
> 
> <http://sas-x.com/>   in English, maintained by [Tal Galili][2], also the owner of R blogs aggregator, <http://r-bloggers.com/>

I try to express in a very symmetrical way. What’s more (and interesting), these two aggregators share a same WordPress template. My blogs, [in Chinese][3] and [in English][4], are also the members of these aggregators respectively. 

I view this is the first wave for SAS programmers to embrace the Web2.0 world. If interested, you could also add your SAS blogs in
