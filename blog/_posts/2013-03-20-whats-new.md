I didn’t [blog](http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/archives/) for a while in this first half March and there are bunches of new stuff to catch up:

I had a new baby! He was delivered on time (and on budget!), _lions tigers and bears, oh my&#8230;_ His brother is Tiger so I named him, Leo.

And I got the latest SAS 9.3 (TS1M2) installed! SAS is jus getting much beautiful.

[OpenCDISC](http://www.opencdisc.org/download) had the latest release, Version 1.4 with the new SDTM 3.1.3 validation checks,—and yes CDISC itself also had some significant updates:

SDTMv1.3 and SDTMIGv3.1.3 now have the [machine readable metadata](http://www.cdisc.org/sdtmv1-4-sdtmigv3-1-3-metadata) online. It’s a nice improvement (last year I just posted _[The Great, Open, Vendor-neutral, Platform-independent Data Standards, . . . Yet in PDF Formats](http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/2012/12/29/cdisc-in-pdf-format/))_.

[Define-XML](http://www.cdisc.org/define-xml) now turns to 2.0 (finally). 

[R](http://cran.rstudio.com/) had its final 2.* release, Version 2.15.3 and Version 3.0.0 will just come soon. [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop) also had a update recently. RStudio is the best IDE (not just R IDE) I used.

[Google will shut down Google Reader](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html), the best RSS reader ever. It’s a huge loss and I tell you, for example, the famous SAS and statistical blogger Wensui Liu, once frequently posted on Windows Live Space, and then Blogspot and finally [WordPress](http://statcompute.wordpress.com/). The former two blogs were closed and Google Reader feed is the only way to archive these lost posts!
