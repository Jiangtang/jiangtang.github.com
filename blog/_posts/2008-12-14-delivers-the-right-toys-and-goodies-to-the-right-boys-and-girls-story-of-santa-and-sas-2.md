How to know the boys and girls’ real demands around the world? and how to predict their demands in next Christmas?

How to purchase toys and goodies with a balance of costs and profits? and how to deliver them more efficiently?

There are lots of questions in the list of Santa, CEO of Santa’s Workshop. SAS’s marketing staff held a very creative champion for the coming Christmas. You can watch the[ interview with Santa in youtube.com][1], or read the success story about Santa, [*Santa’s Secret: Magic? No. It’s SAS(R) Business Analytics*][2].

Merry Christmas.
