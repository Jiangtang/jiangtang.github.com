Happy weekend and <a href="http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/2010/12/30/a-sas-programmers-end-year-haiku/" target="_blank">Haiku again</a>!

So… any ideas?

OK. I am a terrible Haiku writer. The sentences are not self explained without&#160; /\*commentaries\*/ . So the story behind the scene…

One day my remote workstation was very very slow due to some network issues. But I still needed to write and run SAS codes in the server which is located in France. It really hurt my fingers from the ergonomic point of view.

“Tango” was my project code. But why Bastille? oh, that day happened to be round the Bastille Day in France. The performance of the remote server that time was just as terrible as the Bastille I want to break so I could do my project work more smoothly!

Note that after my completing this Tango Haiku, I did a Google search and found that there is really a French book called _<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bastille-tango-Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois-Vilar/dp/2742716785" target="_blank">Bastille tango</a>_!
