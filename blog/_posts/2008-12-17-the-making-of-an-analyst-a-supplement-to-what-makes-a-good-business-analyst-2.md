I once commented the entry, [*What Makes a Good Business Analyst*][1] by Rajan Chandras, with an easy tone, *[If You Can Make it Here, You Can Make it Anywhere][2]*. The standards of a good analyst conclude by Rajan, in my opinion, are somewhat of very high bars.</p>

In the recent SASCOM Magazine, Ted Cuzzillo published a relatively moderate enty, say, *[The Making of An Analyst][3]*. This paper is considered the fresh graduates to be an analysts in their first job hunting. Yes, there two posts are more compatible than oppositive. Rajanâ€™s targets are those veteran analysts with years of experience.
