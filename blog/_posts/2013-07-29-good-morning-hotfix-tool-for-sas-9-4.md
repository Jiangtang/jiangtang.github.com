The first news I got from todayâ€™s inbox is that SAS Hot Fix Analysis Download and Deployment Tool (SASHFADD) for SAS 9.4 is released today.&#160; Just yesterday I found [it was not available](http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/2013/07/28/open-box-sas-9-4-in-windows-7/). 

I did a quick launching and it works fine. Check it out:
