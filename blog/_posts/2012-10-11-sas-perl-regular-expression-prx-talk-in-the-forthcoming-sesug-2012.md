Research Triangle will host SouthEast SAS Users Group ([SESUG][1]) 2012 conference (October 14-16, Sheraton Imperial Hotel, Durham, NC; *back to the home of SAS!*). It will be my first regional SAS user conference and I will have a talk on [SAS Perl Regular Expression(PRX)][2], in the morning of next Monday, Oct 15.

[![Iknow][4]][4]

SAS PRX is an old school topic somehow. After dumping the paper, I think I should restructure my talk in a more accessible way. Regular expression is the de facto standard tool for text processing (*you can get help from the whole world besides SAS!*), and SAS 9.3 even incorporates it to Proc Format. My talk will go like this:

*   No picnic! You are already using Regex: remember *.sas? 
*   Where to start? what you should do is only to fill the programming block 
*   Supporting tools: visually play with Regex 
*   Resources: how to get the Regex for immediate use without digging into the “hairy” metacharacters for days and weeks 
*   A demo 
*   A Joke 

See you then!
