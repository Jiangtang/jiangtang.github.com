In the latest post, [*What Makes a Good Business Analyst?*][1], Rajan Chandras cites some soft items from  *Forrester’s Business Analyst Assessment Workbook*:  
 

*   Ability to think abstractly, identify patterns, and generate ideas and solutions
*   Understanding of when and how to escalate issues or needs
*   Understanding of and ability to delivery the appropriate level of detail needed for each task
*   Interest in exploring and understanding new concepts and topic areas
*   Emotionally invested in the work
*   Ability to learn by shadowing stakeholders
*   Ability to clearly articulate technology in terms stakeholders can understand
*   Understanding of the organizational culture and its impact on processes and projects (this one seems obvious, but the latter phrase is more profound than might seem at first glance)
*   Ability to drive a decision analysis and selection process
*   Ability to recognize patterns in requirements and categorize them appropriately

What’s more, there are some suggestions by Rajan Chandras himself: 

*   Know the organization’s external environment: its competitive position, current state of the industry, geographical & social factors, etc.
*   Know the organization’s internal environment: its financial position, organization culture, IT maturity, etc.
*   Adapt to the needs (your language, dress etc.), but be yourself. Imperfect, yet genuine, is fine; falsity comes through easily, and will destroy your credibility in no time.

No doubt, no boss can reject such a perfect analyst. But I’m afraid these standards are suitable for every professionals. That is to say, they create a model to explain everything. It is too universal to be served as a good filter to select the most proper analysts. She or he may more marketable in any other business line.
