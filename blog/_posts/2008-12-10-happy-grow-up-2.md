I read this verse in W. Bennentt’s popular book, *[The Book of Virtues][3]*, during the bus-to-company time this morning. It’s interesting to read Stevenson’s *Treasure Island*, of course in Chinese edition when I was young.

Yes, it sounds “uncool”, –I went to work, with technical documents in my bag, and read a for-children book. A grown-up with childlike innocence? dare not say. I just read the book to fresh my mind and my English.</p>

It snows little Beijing.
