Well I think blogging is still cool (*and *[*awesome*][3]* and *[*awesome*][4] …). The most appealing personal reason is, blog posts are Google searchable and suitable for archive while Tweets NOT. Admittedly I hold some sort of  [Existentialism 2.0][5]: 

> if it is not Google searched, it doesn’t exit!

Last month I placed a post on how to [*keep pace with CDISC*][6]* *from its official channel*s *and I feel cool to add an appendix of source from the *awesome* blogosphere. Fortunately or not, CDISC is still in the niche market of topics and it takes few efforts to get the list(update me if someone else available! if you are a Google Reader user, just simply import [*this file*][7], my Google Reader subscription on CDISC):

**1. Blog @ **[**Assero**][8]** by **[**Dave Iberson-Hurst**][9]** (“Dave IH”)**

> <http://www.assero.co.uk/category/blog/>

Insightful and full of humor. I retweeted all of its latest posts and you can feel somehow on these tittles (YES on CDISC):

> #### [*What I Want, What I Really Really Want*][10]
> 
> #### [*Churchill, the FDA and a Fall*][11]
> 
> #### [*Mad March and the FDA*][12]

Btw, I write blogs casual way while it is very impressive to read IH reminding me the George Orwell style.

**2. **[**d-Wise Technologies**][13]** Blog**

> <http://www.d-wise.com/blog/>

It is my employer’s official blog site where [Chris Decker][14] is the key contributor to CDISC. You can check out his latest posts on [FDA/PhUSE Annual Computational Science Symposium][15] where he served as committee lead:

> #### [*Overcoming Industry Challenges: A Shift to Collaboration*][16]
> 
> #### [*Validation and Quality: Are They the Same?*][17]

I will also commit to update this blog as my understanding on clinical standards goes. Here is the saying:

> look to the master,   
> follow the master,   
> walk with the master,   
> see through the master,   
> become the master.

**3.  **[**XML4Pharma**][18]** Blog**

> <http://cdiscguru.blogspot.com/>

with industry news and hard (while cool) way writing on XML (CDISC ODM, define.xml).

**4. **[**eClinical Trends**][19]** by [Clinovo][20]**

> <http://blog.clinovo.com/category/cdisc/>

Clinovo jumps to this topic by launching a CDISC SDTM convertor CDISC Express.

**5. eClinicalOpinion**

> <http://eclinicalopinion.blogspot.com/>

This blog is most focused on EDC, the clinical data management part. I like its [series discussion on CDISC ODM][21].

**6. eCTD Regulatory Submissions Network**

> <http://ectdregulatorysubmissionsnetwork.blogspot.com/>

This is a personal blog by Shakul Hameed. I read it mostly to get some information on submission requirements from European regulatory.

**7. HL7 Watch**

> <http://hl7-watch.blogspot.com/>

while it is not CDISC directly related (#6 also), it’s nice to get some voice of [HL7][23] which would be the future of CDISC.

**8. From a Logical Point of View-CDISC**

> <http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/category/cdisc/>

Yes this one, my 2 cents. I will keep recording my personal immersion and understanding on CDISC and related clinical standards. (while it is privilege to cross reference oneself in his/her own blog! Keep awesome, keep blogging.) 

**9. Linked Data and URI:s for Enterprises**

> <http://kerfors.blogspot.com/>

Look at the colon (:) in the title of this blog and you’re right this blog plays (at least) with XML. I find it is good resource (thanks [@kerfors][24] for referencing!) to learn ODM, the foundation of CDISC while the latest post is 

> *[Semantic models for CDISC based standard and metadata management][25]*



P.S.: Blogger [Chris Hemedinger][26] maintains a nice [list of SAS bloggers][27] ([*blogs by SAS employees*][28], and [*blogs by SAS customers, consultants, and the analytics community*][29]).
