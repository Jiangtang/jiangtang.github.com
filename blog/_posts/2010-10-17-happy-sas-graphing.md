I’m not a [R](http://www.r-project.org/) user. Instead, I’m an observer. For example, I love the R Graph Gallery:

As a SAS programmer, I also love [Robert Allison](http://robslink.com/)&#8216;s SAS/Graph Examples and [Michael Friendly](http://www.datavis.ca)&#8216;s SAS Graphic Programs and Macros (the only two SAS graph galleries available on website maintained by users):

I used to be a casual user of SAS Graph. I’d like to add Graph into my toolbox in the following month: half of it due to the encouragement of the two SAS graph gurus, the other half SAS 9.2’s exciting enhancement on graphics.

p.s: the official SAS graph  gallery:
