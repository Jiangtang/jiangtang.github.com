My paper *[Work Smarter than Harder-tools for growing up a SAS programmer][1]* was accepted by [SAS Global Forum 2011.][2] It would be my first time to attend SAS user group conference worldwide. The draft version is available at

Welcome for any comments.

The SGF2011 will be held at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. The interesting thing is that, as far as I know, Caesars Palace in Las Vegas was also the host for SUGI 1978(Jan 30-Feb 1, 1978). looking forward to seeing my SAS gurus in Caesars Palace next year, a place of history.
