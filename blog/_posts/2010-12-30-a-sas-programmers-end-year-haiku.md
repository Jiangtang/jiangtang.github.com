[End year Haiku][1] again!

Yesterday I finished my project, wrote a Haiku to colleagues worldwide to say happy new year, then closed my desktop, said goodbye to colleagues still in office:

> In December my baby born
> 
> my project deliveries followed on
> 
> Now my computers shutdown
> 
> do until(6 Jan 2011) I will be OOO
> 
> Please take blessings from John

Happy New Year!
