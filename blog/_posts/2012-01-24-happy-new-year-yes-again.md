Then I feel great to reset my year of 2012 as brand new one.

Today, Jan 23, is the first day of [Chinese New Year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year), and it is Monday, the first day of work week&#8211;it is always joyful to have such coincidence<span style="font-family: Wingdings;">J</span>. HAPPY NEW YEAR!

I had a big move this year. Actually I passed through multiply new years of 2012: I took my flight from Beijing in Jan 1 (<span style="font-size: 7pt;"><em>happy new year!</em></span>) and landed in Raleigh, North Carolina also in the same day due to the time difference among China and US where I take a new job as a Life Sciences Consultant at [d-Wise Technologies](http://www.d-wise.com/). I&#8217;m not supposed to be a pure SAS programmer any more, but I don&#8217;t want to change the theme of my blog (&#8220;[_Hello World by A SAS Programmer_](http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/)&#8220;) since my most handy language is still SAS while my role will expose me more SAS products and solutions.

Chinese New Year is also called &#8220;Spring Festival&#8221; and &#8220;spring&#8221; is always the key word for the holiday:

  <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Chinese Characters for &#8220;the Beauty of Spring&#8221;. I wrote these years before in Beijing)<br /> </span>
</p>

And I also want to spread my spring greetings with few sentences from Walt Whitman, _These I Singing in Spring_:

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
  THESE, I, singing in spring, collect for lovers,
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
  . . .
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
  Collecting, I traverse the garden, the world—but soon
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
  I pass the gates,
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
  Now along the pond-side—now wading in a little, fearing not the wet,
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
  Now by the post-and-rail fences, where the old stones
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
  thrown there, pick&#8217;d from the fields, have accumulated,
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
  (Wild-flowers and vines and weeds come up through
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
  the stones, and partly cover them—Beyond these I pass,)
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
  Far, far in the forest, before I think where I go,
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
  Solitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and then in the silence,
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
  Alone I had thought—yet soon a troop gathers around me,
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
  Some walk by my side, and some behind, and some embrace my arms or neck,
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
  They, the spirits of dear friends, dead or alive—thicker
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
  they come, a great crowd, and I in the middle,
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
  Collecting, dispensing, singing in spring, there I wander with them,
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
  Plucking something for tokens—tossing toward whoever is near me;
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
  . . .
