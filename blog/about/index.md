Hey my fellow readers, I’m Jiangtang Hu, a Life Sciences Consultant at [d-Wise Technologies][1] in Raleigh, NC. My routine job is clinical data standards implementation (CDISC for sure).

I moved from Beijing, China to US and it would be nice to add few notes for name pronunciation:

*   Some friends pronounce my last name “Hu” in “Huston”. Sure it is OK while it really sounds “HOO” in “Yahoo”, in the Chinese tone.
*   Also for my first name, “JiangTang”, it sounds exactly like “JohnTown” and more fellow friends just call me Jiang, John or JT for short.

For more information, please *see* [my homepage][2]:
