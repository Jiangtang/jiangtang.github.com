Hey my fellow readers, I&#8217;m Jiangtang Hu, a Life Sciences Consultant at <a href="http://www.d-wise.com/" target="_blank">d-Wise Technologies</a> in Raleigh, NC. My routine job is clinical data standards implementation (CDISC for sure).

I moved from Beijing, China to US and it would be nice to add few notes for name pronunciation:

  * Some friends pronounce my last name &#8220;Hu&#8221; in &#8220;Huston&#8221;. Sure it is OK while it really sounds &#8220;HOO&#8221; in &#8220;Yahoo&#8221;, in the Chinese tone.
  * Also for my first name, &#8220;JiangTang&#8221;, it sounds exactly like &#8220;JohnTown&#8221; and more fellow friends just call me Jiang, John or JT for short.
