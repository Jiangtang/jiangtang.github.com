    <div class="article-content">
      <p>My first post on SAS bloggers begins with <a href="http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/2011/07/17/sas-bloggers-in-action1-rick-wicklin-sasiml-and-color-revolution/" target="_blank">Rick Wicklin</a> and I plan a series of posts. It would be nice for a statement of rational before following pages.</p>

<p>As a learner, I benefit frequently from lots of high quality blogs. But I’m also slightly lazy as a reader: I read almost all blogs in Google Reader rather than returning to the original web pages and adding some comments. Here I’d like to post a series of SAS bloggers and their blogs (that I subscribed and read frequently) to extent my thanks, share with friends and sometimes amuse the bloggers themselves:)</p>

<p>In this page, honor belongs to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jian-dai/1a/1b/b05" target="_blank">Jian Dai</a> and his Yahoo group, “<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/sas_academy/" target="_blank">SAS Academy</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/sas_academy/">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/sas_academy/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait. You may ask: a Yahoo group?</p>

<p>Jian actually is a blogger for a collective blog, _<a href="http://blog.clinovo.com/" target="_blank">Clinical Trial New Technologies &amp; Best Practices</a>_. But here I’d like to refer this Yahoo group which actually serves as his own blog and I also use Google Reader to subscribe its RSS feed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>launched at December of 2008</p>

<p>444 posts till July 2011, averagely 14 posts per month (and roughly 1 post for every 2 days!)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And all in all, most (and almost every) posts are under Jian’s name and few posts come from other’s hands are just outlier-like(less than 10). Note that I just read all the historical messages in a weekend and got the impressions. In the following page, I might <a href="http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/2011/07/20/retrieve-blogs-using-sas/" target="_blank">retrieve all the data</a> from the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/sas_academy/" target="_blank">SAS Academy</a> and supply accurate reports.</p>

<p>Recently Jian posted <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/sas_academy/message/454" target="_blank">a C implementation of a SAS tokenizer</a> based on Finite-state Machine(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine" target="_blank">FSM</a>). A tokenizer is a lexical analyzer of a specific programming language and in this case you can just imagine it is a small part of SAS Supervisor to recognize all <a href="http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/mcrolref/61885/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a001961603.htm" target="_blank">tokens</a>. In <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/sas_academy/" target="_blank">SAS Academy</a>, Jian posted lots wonderful (and beautiful) implementation of lots of general or specific problems using <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/sas_academy/messages/425?l=1" target="_blank">C</a>, <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/sas_academy/msearch?query=perl&submit=Search&charset=UTF-8" target="_blank">Perl</a>, <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/sas_academy/msearch?query=JScript&submit=Search&charset=UTF-8" target="_blank">JScript</a>, <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/sas_academy/msearch?query=JavaScript&submit=Search&charset=UTF-8" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>, <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/sas_academy/msearch?query=PowerShell&submit=Search&charset=UTF-8" target="_blank">PowerShell</a>, <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/sas_academy/msearch?query=vb*&submit=Search&charset=UTF-8" target="_blank">VBS/VBA</a>, &hellip; and even <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/sas_academy/msearch?query=ProLog&submit=Search&charset=UTF-8" target="_blank">ProLog</a>, a general logic programming language!</p>

<p>Wait wait. You may wonder: is Jian a SAS programmer?</p>

<p>I don’t know how Jian identify himself as a programmer and it would be best to leave this question to himself. But don’t worry. There is no such phrase engraved at the door of Jian’s <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/sas_academy/" target="_blank">SAS Academy</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let no one ignorant of C/Perl enter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually Jian is a SAS/statistical/clinical programmer by job and he of course has lots of interesting SAS codes posted, including SAS implementation of <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/sas_academy/msearch?query=Lambda+&submit=Search&charset=UTF-8" target="_blank">Lambda Expression</a> and <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/sas_academy/msearch?query=recursion&submit=Search&charset=UTF-8" target="_blank">recursion</a>(Jian is also an active conference speaker on this topic). &#8211;Some clinical programmers without any computer background would find it difficult to understand the CS part even of Jian’s SAS codes, for example, <strong>Lambda Expression</strong>. Suggestion: Google it and you will enter a totally new joy world.</p>

<p>Jian plays like a geek, and he is always making efforts to extend the horizon and scope of SAS programming language by taking advantage from computer science(actually he had some posts titled <em><strong>play like a CS pro</strong></em>). I have great experience by exploring Jian’s <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/sas_academy/" target="_blank">SAS Academy</a> and very often, a popular book title pops up in my mind:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Pearls-2nd-Jon-Bentley/dp/0201657880" target="_blank">Programming Pearls</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want sometimes programming for fun, just for fun, that’s it.</p>
