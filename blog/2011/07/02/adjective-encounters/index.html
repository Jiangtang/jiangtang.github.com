      <blockquote>
<p>Really she is the strangest creature in the world, far from heroic, variable as a weathercock, “<strong>bashful, insolent; chaste, lustful; prating, silent; laborious, delicate; ingenious, heavy; melancholic, pleasant; lying, true; knowing, ignorant; liberal, covetous, and prodigal</strong>”— in short, so complex, so indefinite, …</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8211;Virginia Woolf, <em>The Common Reader</em>, First Series (1925)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know if Ernest Hemingway is still one of the recognized dominant writers in colleges English education. At least once&#160; a time he WAS. In an extreme form, he used only nouns and verbs to construct sentences.</p>

<p>In my personal English education(as Second Language), admittedly that there is also an absence of adjectives. It is just wonderful, nice, great, cool, weird, awesome,&#160; and all in all, everything is OK or not OK, good or not good. In writing, my sentences lack of tone and shades. I write only technical articles in English and people can often well manage the so-called technical borings when acquiring information, knowledge, and opinions.</p>

<p>In reading when I try to just read for the sake of reading itself, I also find it is difficult to dig into pure literature pages where rich adjectives assembled heavily. I only read smoothly technical papers. So when I happened to have a paper book of Woolf and also loaded a corresponding public domain e-book in Kindle, I read the most intensive instances of adjectives ever. It is really totally different experiences.</p>

<p>There would be three types in any languages. For English:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in the top, pure literature, Shakespeare-like;</p>

<p>middle, which could be called the universal or international English; it is be the dominate English among nations in business, technology and even academia; most of the popular writers also utilize such sort of English to extent their global reputation;</p>

<p>bottom, the street language, slangs, talk-show.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I penetrate the English through the middle like almost all of the ESL learners. It is the most convenient and effective way in a very short run. But for a leap in long run, some friends just suggest that I should go down the street or climb up to the top. Ok I am on the way. Virginia Woolf is the first stop and I keep the first notes.</p>
