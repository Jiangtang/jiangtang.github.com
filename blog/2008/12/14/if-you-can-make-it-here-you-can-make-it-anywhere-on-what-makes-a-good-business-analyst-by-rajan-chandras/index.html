      <p>In the latest post, <a href="http://www.intelligententerprise.com/blog/archives/2008/12/what_makes_a_go.html"><em><span class="HeadGiantblack">What Makes a Good Business Analyst?</span></em></a>, Rajan Chandras cites some soft items from  <span class="hpTopStoryBlurb"><em>Forrester&#8217;s Business Analyst Assessment Workbook</em>:<br /> </span> <span class="hpTopStoryBlurb"></span></p>

<ul>
<li>Ability to think abstractly, identify patterns, and generate ideas and solutions</li>
<li>Understanding of when and how to escalate issues or needs</li>
<li>Understanding of and ability to delivery the appropriate level of detail needed for each task</li>
<li>Interest in exploring and understanding new concepts and topic areas</li>
<li>Emotionally invested in the work</li>
<li>Ability to learn by shadowing stakeholders</li>
<li>Ability to clearly articulate technology in terms stakeholders can understand</li>
<li>Understanding of the organizational culture and its impact on processes and projects (this one seems obvious, but the latter phrase is more profound than might seem at first glance)</li>
<li>Ability to drive a decision analysis and selection process</li>
<li>Ability to recognize patterns in requirements and categorize them appropriately</li>
</ul>

<p>What&#8217;s more, there are some suggestions by Rajan Chandras himself: <span class="hpTopStoryBlurb"></span></p>

<ul>
<li>Know the organization&#8217;s external environment: its competitive position, current state of the industry, geographical &amp; social factors, etc.</li>
<li>Know the organization&#8217;s internal environment: its financial position, organization culture, IT maturity, etc.</li>
<li>Adapt to the needs (your language, dress etc.), but be yourself. Imperfect, yet genuine, is fine; falsity comes through easily, and will destroy your credibility in no time.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="hpTopStoryBlurb">No doubt, no boss can reject such a perfect analyst. But I&#8217;m afraid these standards are suitable for every professionals.</span> <span class="hpTopStoryBlurb">That is to say, they create a model to explain everything. It is too universal to be served as a good filter to select the most proper analysts. She or he may more marketable in any other business line.</span></p>
