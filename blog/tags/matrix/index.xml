      <description>Since SAS 9.3, ODS Graphics was moved into Base SAS and other statistical procedures, which means the SAS/Graph license is not needed anymore to access ODS Graphics facilities. It’s definitely nice, but from customers’ point of view, it is not critical necessary: since the “minimum set of SAS system” in most SAS sessions includes the Base SAS, SAS/Stat and SAS/Graph, there is almost no impact for SAS users to switch the license of ODS Graphics.</description>

      <description>Recently I read Rick Wicklin’s IML blog with great interests(and anticipation for his fore-coming IML book,&amp;#160; Statistical Programming with SAS/IML Software). SAS programmers have the following programming tools to facilitate their daily work:
 SAS data step: the basic SAS; a generation IV programming language, similar with other procedural languages such as C. SAS Proc SQL: SAS’s implementation of standard SQL(SQL-92). SAS IML(Interactive Matrix Language): SAS’s matrix manipulation language(like R and Matlab).</description>
