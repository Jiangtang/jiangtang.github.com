      <title>In Search of Lost Time: 2016</title>

      <description>2016 was gone, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t even leave one single blog post. An obvious inference should be, 2016 doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist&amp;hellip;
2016 was a year of struggle for me as a SAS programmer. I earn my bread mostly using SAS, but is a SAS programmer like me cool? It&amp;rsquo;s not a silly question. Lots of SAS programmers feel the crunch.
So, in 2016, I
 learned some Python, attended Pydata Carolinas, learned some Spark, and got certified by edX somehow with all the bubble words in the title, Distributed Machine Learning with Apache Spark, learned some math, Linear Algebra, learned more math, Probability, learned even more math, Numerical Analysis, and didn&amp;rsquo;t update one single blog post, because all my spare time and coffee making time were simply run out.</description>

      <title>Import .Rdata to SAS, along with Labels</title>

      <description>I didn’t play with SAS/IML for a while. I call it back when I need to read some R format data.
Technically, .Rdata is not a data format. It’s rather a big container to hold bunch of R objects:

In this example, when a .Rdata is loaded, 3 objects are included where ‘data’(the ‘real’ data) and ‘desc’ (data description portion) are of our interests.
SAS/IML offers a nice interface to call R command which can be used to read the R format data:</description>

      <title>Use List Object in SAS: Yet Another Undocumented Feature in SAS 9.4</title>

      <description>Last year I gave a talk in SESUG 2013 on list manipulation on SAS using a collection of function-like macros. Today I just explored in my recently upgraded SAS 9.4 that I can play with list natively, which means I can create a list, slice a list and do other list operations in Data Steps! This is not documented yet(which means it will not be supported by the software vendor) and I can see warning message in Log window like “WARNING: List object is preproduction in this release”, and it is still limited somehow, so use it in your own risk (and of course, fun).</description>

      <description>I didn’t blog for a while in this first half March and there are bunches of new stuff to catch up:
I had a new baby! He was delivered on time (and on budget!), lions tigers and bears, oh my&amp;#8230; His brother is Tiger so I named him, Leo.
And I got the latest SAS 9.3 (TS1M2) installed! SAS is jus getting much beautiful.

OpenCDISC had the latest release, Version 1.</description>

      <description>PhUSE-FDA Working Group 5 (Development of Standard Scripts for Analysis and Programming) just adopted Google Code as collaborative programming platform. Google Code is one of the most popular and respected open source software hosting sites in the world and it is definitely a good choice for PhUSE-FDA WG5.
But after viewing one of WG5’s working reports, Sharing Standard Statistical Scripts and getting to know why they finally chose Google Code (rather than Github which was also tested by WG5 members), I think it’s necessary to clarify some misunderstanding against Github where I’m also an occasional user.</description>

      <description>I spent almost all of my blogging time last month to follow an online course in Coursera, Computing for Data Analysis (with R) by Dr. Roger&amp;#160; Peng of Johns Hopkins, Biostatistics Department. I already checked out bunch of Coursera courses just to take a look at what else MOOC look like, this R course was the first and only one I took seriously: I reviewed all slides (although didn’t watch the videos since I didn’t have enough time) and most important, finished all programming assignments(and got full score!</description>

      <title>Incorporate SAS/IML to Base SAS?</title>

      <description>Since SAS 9.3, ODS Graphics was moved into Base SAS and other statistical procedures, which means the SAS/Graph license is not needed anymore to access ODS Graphics facilities. It’s definitely nice, but from customers’ point of view, it is not critical necessary: since the “minimum set of SAS system” in most SAS sessions includes the Base SAS, SAS/Stat and SAS/Graph, there is almost no impact for SAS users to switch the license of ODS Graphics.</description>

      <description>It is said in An Introduction to R, one of R official documents (Current Version: 2.15.1):
 There is an important difference in philosophy between S (and hence R) and the other main statistical systems. In S a statistical analysis is normally done as a series of steps, with intermediate results being stored in objects. Thus whereas SAS and SPSS will give copious output from a regression or discriminant analysis, R will give minimal output and store the results in a fit object for subsequent interrogation by further R functions.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Calculate the factorial of 171 (171!)? Just TRY! It is equal to 171*170*169*….2*1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-google-calculator&#34;&gt;1. Google calculator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Google fanatics, I first try to search the answer via Google:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Google171.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto&#34; title=&#34;Google171&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Google171&#34; src=&#34;http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Google171_thumb.png&#34; width=&#34;336&#34; height=&#34;116&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoops, nothing interested returned! Type “170!” and get the output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Google170.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto&#34; title=&#34;Google170&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Google170&#34; src=&#34;http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Google170_thumb.png&#34; width=&#34;244&#34; height=&#34;110&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Why kinda things happened in this calculator? 171! is just equal to 171*170!.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-excel&#34;&gt;2. Excel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switch to Excel spreadsheet. Function fact(*) used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Excel170.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto&#34; title=&#34;Excel170&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Excel170&#34; src=&#34;http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Excel170_thumb.png&#34; width=&#34;228&#34; height=&#34;66&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Excel171.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto&#34; title=&#34;Excel171&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Excel171&#34; src=&#34;http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Excel171_thumb.png&#34; width=&#34;244&#34; height=&#34;64&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Oo, interesting. The same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-sas&#34;&gt;3. SAS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google and Excel may be the niche players in calculators’ family. Why not try to use some programming languages?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Recently I start to learn the algorithms and applications of feature selection. The term “Feature”, wildly used in machine learning and data mining literatures, simply means “Variable”. In some practices, for example, a neural network model uses a decision tree as input; the tree performs the function of variables selection.
The Arizona State University is maintaining a repository of feature selection, including original documentations, Matlab packages and user guide for the following popular algorithms so far:</description>
