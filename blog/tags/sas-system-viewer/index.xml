      <description>This is sad, really sad. SAS System Viewer is not officially supported by SAS since the launch of SAS Universal Viewer, but it can still open SAS 9.3 datasets and I love it. SAS System Viewer is mush superior than SAS Universal Viewer and any other data viewers in Enterprise Guide, JMP, SAS Drug Development and SAS Data Integration Studio regarding response time.
[update 2014/03/18] A new SAS 9.4 data set option &amp;#8220;EXTENDOBSCOUNTER&amp;#8221; prevents SV to read the data set correctly, see</description>

      <description>SAS Universal Viewer (UV) jumped out since SAS 9.2 and in most cases, it’s installed as replacement for the SAS System Viewer(SV) but I reinstalled SV in all machines where I had the right privileges. UV has some nice new feature but for me it is extremely and unacceptably slow. Every time I open a relatively not entirely small dataset (literally, 30MB) in UV, it shows up “initializing” forever (even the initializing process is done, I guess).</description>
