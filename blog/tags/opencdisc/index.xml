      <description>I didn’t blog for a while in this first half March and there are bunches of new stuff to catch up:

And I got the latest SAS 9.3 (TS1M2) installed! SAS is jus getting much beautiful.

      <description>The lasted OpenCDISC Validator version 1.3 was released at 29 March, 2012 (btw, there is a typo in the Line 1 of CHANGELOG.txt within the package: “2012” not “2011”). As usual, you can submit the following SAS scripts to get some basic information(remember to customize your directory):   filename CDISC url &#34;https://raw.github.com/Jiangtang/Programming-SAS/master/Rules_Count_OpenCDISC_XML.sas&#34;;  %include CDISC;  %Rules_Count_OpenCDISC_XML(dir=C:OpenCDISC1.3compareopencdisc-validator_1.3config)   and you get a summary of validation rules of OpenCDISC Validator V1.</description>

 Currently I only created one repo as personal SAS code repository. To kill weekend time, I uploaded piece of codes to count the OpenCDISC validation rules by models. To use it:
 filename CDISC url “https://raw.github.com/Jiangtang/Programming-SAS/master/Rules_Count_OpenCDISC_XML.sas”;
%include CDISC;
%Rules_Count_OpenCDISC_XML(dir=C:tempOpenCDISCsoftwareopencdisc-validatorconfig)
