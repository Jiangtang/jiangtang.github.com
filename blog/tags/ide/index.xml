F4: close other two windows (the current active window is Log window after F3 running; F4 jump to SAS file with full window)
F5: jump to SAS file
F6: jump to Log file
F7: jump to lst file (list output)</description>

I don’t drive into the deep part yet of what WPS can do and can’t do, but I do love the WPS way to organize projects, folders and files (including souse files):</description>
