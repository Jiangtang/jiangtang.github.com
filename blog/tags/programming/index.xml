      <description>My first post on SAS bloggers begins with Rick Wicklin and I plan a series of posts. It would be nice for a statement of rational before following pages.
As a learner, I benefit frequently from lots of high quality blogs. But I’m also slightly lazy as a reader: I read almost all blogs in Google Reader rather than returning to the original web pages and adding some comments. Here I’d like to post a series of SAS bloggers and their blogs (that I subscribed and read frequently) to extent my thanks, share with friends and sometimes amuse the bloggers themselves:)</description>
