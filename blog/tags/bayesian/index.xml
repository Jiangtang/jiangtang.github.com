      <description>A latest updated post on Freakonomics, Beware the Weasel Word “Statistical” in Statistical Significance!,&amp;#160; seemed to attempt to challenge frequentist statistics by Bayesian. I have no research on Bayesian and won’t jump to the debates. I’d rather to use this case to apply the Dragon’s Teeth and Fleas logic of hypothesis testing (at least I think frequentist is pretty intuitive). 
A story goes with this post, that Bob won 20 times out of total 30 rounds with Alice in a children card game, “War”.</description>
