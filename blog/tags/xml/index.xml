      <description>Last year I took a bite of the newly SAS Proc Groovy to read JSON data since there was no direct “proc import” or “infile” or “libname” way to play with JSON. Here is an nice example from SAS official blog, by Falko Schulz where Proc Groovy is used to parse Twitter JSON file:
 How to import Twitter tweets in SAS DATA Step using OAuth 2 authentication style
 PS: Since SAS 9.</description>

      <description>I didn’t blog for a while in this first half March and there are bunches of new stuff to catch up:
I had a new baby! He was delivered on time (and on budget!), lions tigers and bears, oh my&amp;#8230; His brother is Tiger so I named him, Leo.
And I got the latest SAS 9.3 (TS1M2) installed! SAS is jus getting much beautiful.

OpenCDISC had the latest release, Version 1.</description>

      <description>There SAS applications/procedures/features were not necessarily available since 2012. This year I paid special attention to them when began to use SAS 9.3. The following notes are&amp;#160; totally my personal endorsement purely based my own experience as a user:
XML File Reading: SAS XML Mapper 
SAS XML Mapper itself is not an elegant tool from software design perspective (an example: I keep multiple versions because the latest version seems not carry out all the functionalities from old ones), but it is best XML file processing tool for SAS programmers like me.</description>

      <description>The lasted OpenCDISC Validator version 1.3 was released at 29 March, 2012 (btw, there is a typo in the Line 1 of CHANGELOG.txt within the package: “2012” not “2011”). As usual, you can submit the following SAS scripts to get some basic information(remember to customize your directory):   filename CDISC url &#34;https://raw.github.com/Jiangtang/Programming-SAS/master/Rules_Count_OpenCDISC_XML.sas&#34;;  %include CDISC;  %Rules_Count_OpenCDISC_XML(dir=C:OpenCDISC1.3compareopencdisc-validator_1.3config)   and you get a summary of validation rules of OpenCDISC Validator V1.</description>

      <description>OpenCDISC, the first open source CDISC validator, is already in the toolbox of FDA reviewers (CDER/CBER, see CDISC Standards in the Regulatory Submission Process, 26 January 2012, P.33). The key features in OpenCDISC is a dichotomy of validation rules (XML based) and application logic. Currently OpenCDISC Validator (Version 1.2.1) officially supports the four following CDISC modules:
 SDTM 3.1.2 SDTM 3.1.1 Define.xml 1.0 ADaM 1.0  
You can get the corresponding configuration files (validation rules) online or in the software folder (in .</description>

      <description>Last month, I gave a talk, XML: the SAS Approach, in CDISC Interchange China 2010(at the Medical School of Fudan University, Shanghai, 2010-09-15). FDA favors CDISC and HL7, the two XML based standards, and SAS programmers in biopharmaceutical industry&amp;#160; need incorporate the XML technology into their toolboxes. Fortunately, you don’t need to be an XML expert then to play XML in your daily work, and, SAS system DOES offer multiple tools and applications to handle XML files, i.</description>
