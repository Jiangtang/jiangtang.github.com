      <description>This blog, “From A Logical Point of View”, is not supposed to be owned by a logician. Actually, the book, From A Logical Point of View, is a collection of logical and philosophical essays by W.V.Quine(1908-2000), an American philosopher and mathematician. 
A story about this book. From A Logical Point of View, was a calypso song by Robert Mitchum, an US actor, composer and singer. Quine enjoyed this music and used it as his new book, which is Quine’s best seller.</description>
