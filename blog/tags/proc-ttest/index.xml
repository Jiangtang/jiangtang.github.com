      <title>Noninferiority Testing with SAS</title>

      <description>I planed to extend nonWinferiority testing to one of my statistical notes,&amp;#160; Equivalence Testing and TOST (Two One-Sided Test) since noninferiority test is simply half part of the equivalence test. Today I’m glad to find an even better explanation from
 SAS Usage Note 48616: Design and analysis of noninferiority studies
 You will love it if you are interested in this subject (bookmark this link since it looks like unfinished somehow).</description>

      <description>There SAS applications/procedures/features were not necessarily available since 2012. This year I paid special attention to them when began to use SAS 9.3. The following notes are&amp;#160; totally my personal endorsement purely based my own experience as a user:
XML File Reading: SAS XML Mapper 
SAS XML Mapper itself is not an elegant tool from software design perspective (an example: I keep multiple versions because the latest version seems not carry out all the functionalities from old ones), but it is best XML file processing tool for SAS programmers like me.</description>

      <title>Frequentist or Baysian in A Binomial Test</title>

      <description>A latest updated post on Freakonomics, Beware the Weasel Word “Statistical” in Statistical Significance!,&amp;#160; seemed to attempt to challenge frequentist statistics by Bayesian. I have no research on Bayesian and won’t jump to the debates. I’d rather to use this case to apply the Dragon’s Teeth and Fleas logic of hypothesis testing (at least I think frequentist is pretty intuitive). 
A story goes with this post, that Bob won 20 times out of total 30 rounds with Alice in a children card game, “War”.</description>

      <description>Statisticians aren’t the problem for data science. The real problem is too many posers &amp;#8212; Cathy O’Neil
you actually do need to understand how to invert a matrix at some point in your life if you want to be a data scientist. &amp;#8212; Cathy O’Neil
 
I was asked in several different occasions to explain hypothesis testing to non-technical people in plain English. Now I think I got a pretty neat one while honors belong to three great Germans, Friedrich Engels, Karl Marx, and Heinrich Heine.</description>
