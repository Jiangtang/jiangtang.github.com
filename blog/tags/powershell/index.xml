      <description>Just update Windows Powershell to version 3.0 and I do like this new GUI (Integrated Scripting Environment, ISE) with a console, a script window and a command list (Powershell is a true Windows shell; you may try to type 1+2 in the old CMD console!):

      <description>The concept of current working directory in SAS is not as important as it sounds. Most SAS users point to file reference (fileref) and library reference (libname, a “namespace”-like mechanism to access files ), which are much convenient in large project with multiple folders.

 jump to C:\Users\jhu\appdata\Local\Temp\SAS\Temporary Files_TD2820_like folder to get the temporary datasets (in WORK library)  hard code a folder to receive ODS outputs.</description>
