      <description>SAS historians (not all SAS users!) know Anthony James Barr (aka Tony Barr or Jim Barr) was the designer and implementor of SAS language (1966-1979) and the first Chairman and President of SAS Institute (1976-1979). In this picture was Tony Barr in the first SUGI (January 26-28, 1976, Kissimmee, FL), taken by the first SUGI chair Julian Horwich. It’s said in 1970s, everyone had long hair!
I was particularly interested in the early history of SAS when traced back the SAS file system to FFS (Formatted File System) in Tony Barr’s statement, SAS Related History.</description>
