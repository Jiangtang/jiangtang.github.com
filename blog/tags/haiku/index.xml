      <description>Happy weekend and Haiku again!
 My finger hurts,
I can not dance
Tango in Bastille.
 So… any ideas?

OK. I am a terrible Haiku writer. The sentences are not self explained without&amp;#160; /*commentaries*/ . So the story behind the scene…
One day my remote workstation was very very slow due to some network issues. But I still needed to write and run SAS codes in the server which is located in France.</description>

      <description>End year Haiku again!
Yesterday I finished my project, wrote a Haiku to colleagues worldwide to say happy new year, then closed my desktop, said goodbye to colleagues still in office:
 In December my baby born
my project deliveries followed on
Now my computers shutdown
do until(6 Jan 2011) I will be OOO
Please take blessings from John
 Happy New Year!</description>

      <description>First prompts are silent.
Subsequent prompts loud and clear.
Now all prompts are heard.
 Poem from R&amp;amp;D staff?
Yes. Rhyming sonnets were shakespeare-like complex;
they wrote Japanese haiku, showed as above.
The SAS R&amp;amp;D staff should complete some paper work in defects system before changing a code. They use informal descriptive language(HAIKUUU!) in the early stage. Chris Hemedinger, a senior software engineer at SAS, collected some haikus in his blog to show the humor side of SAS R&amp;amp;D staff.</description>
