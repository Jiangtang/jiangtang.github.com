      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the latest post, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.intelligententerprise.com/blog/archives/2008/12/what_makes_a_go.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;HeadGiantblack&#34;&gt;What Makes a Good Business Analyst?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Rajan Chandras cites some soft items from  &lt;span class=&#34;hpTopStoryBlurb&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forrester&amp;#8217;s Business Analyst Assessment Workbook&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;hpTopStoryBlurb&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to think abstractly, identify patterns, and generate ideas and solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of when and how to escalate issues or needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of and ability to delivery the appropriate level of detail needed for each task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest in exploring and understanding new concepts and topic areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotionally invested in the work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to learn by shadowing stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to clearly articulate technology in terms stakeholders can understand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of the organizational culture and its impact on processes and projects (this one seems obvious, but the latter phrase is more profound than might seem at first glance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to drive a decision analysis and selection process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to recognize patterns in requirements and categorize them appropriately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s more, there are some suggestions by Rajan Chandras himself: &lt;span class=&#34;hpTopStoryBlurb&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know the organization&amp;#8217;s external environment: its competitive position, current state of the industry, geographical &amp;amp; social factors, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know the organization&amp;#8217;s internal environment: its financial position, organization culture, IT maturity, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adapt to the needs (your language, dress etc.), but be yourself. Imperfect, yet genuine, is fine; falsity comes through easily, and will destroy your credibility in no time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hpTopStoryBlurb&#34;&gt;No doubt, no boss can reject such a perfect analyst. But I&amp;#8217;m afraid these standards are suitable for every professionals.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;hpTopStoryBlurb&#34;&gt;That is to say, they create a model to explain everything. It is too universal to be served as a good filter to select the most proper analysts. She or he may more marketable in any other business line.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
