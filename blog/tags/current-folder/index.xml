      <description>The concept of current working directory in SAS is not as important as it sounds. Most SAS users point to file reference (fileref) and library reference (libname, a “namespace”-like mechanism to access files ), which are much convenient in large project with multiple folders.
Sometimes I push files to the current folder in relatively small task because I don’t want to
 jump to C:\Users\jhu\appdata\Local\Temp\SAS\Temporary Files_TD2820_like folder to get the temporary datasets (in WORK library)  hard code a folder to receive ODS outputs.</description>
