      <description>I personally nominated SAS ODS Report Writing Interface was the one of the best technology I found in SAS in 2012. It can generates reports cell by cell and row by row and has much flexibility to produce highly customized reports. Basically, to use it,
 first assign an ODS destination. Nothing new, and I prefer HTML like   ods html&amp;#160;&amp;#160; file=&amp;ldquo;output.html&amp;rdquo; style=sasweb;
  then create a object(instance) based on the ODS Report Writing class, odsout,   declare odsout myout();</description>

      <description>There SAS applications/procedures/features were not necessarily available since 2012. This year I paid special attention to them when began to use SAS 9.3. The following notes are&amp;#160; totally my personal endorsement purely based my own experience as a user:
XML File Reading: SAS XML Mapper 
SAS XML Mapper itself is not an elegant tool from software design perspective (an example: I keep multiple versions because the latest version seems not carry out all the functionalities from old ones), but it is best XML file processing tool for SAS programmers like me.</description>
