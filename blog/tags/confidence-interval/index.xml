      <description>This quick note serves as a supplementnote of my previous Statistical Notes (3): Confidence Intervals for Binomial Proportion Using SAS which I will extend as a SESUG 2015 paper. Basically I added a new Blaker method to my CI_Single_Proportion.sas file and found more CIs from SAS PROC FREQ.
First of all, call the script:
 filename CI url “https://raw.github.com/Jiangtang/Programming-SAS/master/CI_Single_Proportion.sas” ; %include CI;
%CI_Single_Proportion(r=81,n=263);
 and the output:

The #12 is the one newly added.</description>

      <description>In Lex’s library of the latest SAS Global Forum 2015 papers, I found an interesting paper by Wu Gong, Jeffreys Interval for One-Sample Proportion with SAS/STAT Software, where SAS MCMC procedure and a so called Random Walk Metropolis Algorithm were implemented to calculate the Jeffreys interval for binomial proportion.
Years ago I wrote several posts on this topic:

      <description>For the computing of confidence intervals for difference between two independent binomial proportions in SAS 9.4/STAT 12.3, it’s hard to figure out exactly how many methods are available because there is no “CL=ALL” trigger in RISKDIFF option (but you can get one in BIONOMIAL option to compute the confidence intervals for binomial proportion). As far as I hacked, I got 11 intervals (last year I tried SAS 9.3 and got 8; codes available below):</description>

      <description>1. A new confidence limits method added, Wilson (Corrected) 2. The binomialc option is no longer documented, but still works        After getting the access to SAS 9.4 alone with SAS/STAT 12.3, I first took a look at my favorite SAS statistical procedure, PROF FREQ.&amp;#160; Last year I had a note on confidence intervals for binomial proportion based on SAS 9.</description>

      <description>A guy notices a bunch of targets scattered over a barn wall, and in the center of each, in the &amp;ldquo;bulls-eye,&amp;rdquo; is a bullet hole. &amp;ldquo;Wow,&amp;rdquo; he says to the farmer, &amp;ldquo;that&amp;#8217;s pretty good shooting. How&amp;#8217;d you do it?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Oh,&amp;rdquo; says the farmer, &amp;ldquo;it was easy. I painted the targets after I shot the holes.&amp;rdquo; – An Old Joke

      <description>Check it out: a new book on confidence intervals for proportions by Prof. Robert G. Newcombe&amp;#160; just recently available from CRC Press:

 Confidence Intervals for Proportions and Related Measures of Effect Size
 This book also supplies a set of Excel spreadsheets to calculating CIs, see

      <description>The following two papers by Professor Robert Newcombe, in my limit observation, are the most frequently cited papers in the industry for CI calculation:
 Two-sided confidence intervals for the single proportion: comparison of seven methods.
Newcombe RG, Stat Med , Volume 17 , 8 (April 1998) pp.857-872  Interval estimation for the difference between independent proportions: comparison of eleven methods.
