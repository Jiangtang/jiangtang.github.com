      <description>A latest updated post on Freakonomics, Beware the Weasel Word “Statistical” in Statistical Significance!,&amp;#160; seemed to attempt to challenge frequentist statistics by Bayesian. I have no research on Bayesian and won’t jump to the debates. I’d rather to use this case to apply the Dragon’s Teeth and Fleas logic of hypothesis testing (at least I think frequentist is pretty intuitive). 
A story goes with this post, that Bob won 20 times out of total 30 rounds with Alice in a children card game, “War”.</description>

      <description>Statisticians aren’t the problem for data science. The real problem is too many posers &amp;#8212; Cathy O’Neil
you actually do need to understand how to invert a matrix at some point in your life if you want to be a data scientist. &amp;#8212; Cathy O’Neil
 
I was asked in several different occasions to explain hypothesis testing to non-technical people in plain English. Now I think I got a pretty neat one while honors belong to three great Germans, Friedrich Engels, Karl Marx, and Heinrich Heine.</description>
