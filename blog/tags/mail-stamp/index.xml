      <description>One of the interesting observations in my first few months in US: there is no price printed in the new mail stamps!
It is interesting because as a former student of economics, I think US Post system did a nice attempt to beat the so called “menu cost” which should honor to Harvard economist Mankiw. Literally the menu cost is the cost of a restaurant to print new menus due to price adjustment.</description>
