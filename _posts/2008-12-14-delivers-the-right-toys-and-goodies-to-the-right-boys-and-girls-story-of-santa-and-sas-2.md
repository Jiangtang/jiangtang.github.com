How to know the boys and girls&#8217; real demands around the world? and how to predict their demands in next Christmas?

How to purchase toys and goodies with a balance of costs and profits? and how to deliver them more efficiently?

There are lots of questions in the list of Santa, CEO of Santa&#8217;s Workshop. SAS&#8217;s marketing staff held a very creative champion for the coming Christmas. You can watch the [interview with Santa in youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtE7XOGZV4&eurl=&feature=player_embedded), or read the success story about Santa, [_Santa&#8217;s Secret: Magic? No. It&#8217;s SAS(R) Business Analytics_](http://www.sas.com/success/santa.html).

Merry Christmas.
