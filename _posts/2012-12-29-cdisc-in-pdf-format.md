You know I mean the <a href="http://www.cdisc.org/mission-and-principles" target="_blank">CDISC</a> standards including CDASH, SDTM, SEND, ADaM, â€¦ and you are right there are few not only in PDF format (ODM, define.xml for example). 

Today Jozef (Jos) Aerts from <a href="http://www.xml4pharma.com" target="_blank">XML4Pharma</a> posted his <a href="http://cdiscguru.blogspot.com/2012/12/another-copy-and-paste-frustration.html" target="_blank">frustration of copying and pasting metadata from only PDF-formed SDTM-IG 3.1.4</a>.&#160; I hate to complain the volunteer work by the CDISC team but it is worth a discussion, [is there any better way to publish CDISC Standards](http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/2012/07/19/publishing-cdisc-standards/)?
