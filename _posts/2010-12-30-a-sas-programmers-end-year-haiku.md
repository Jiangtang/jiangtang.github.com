<a href="http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/2008/12/10/haiku-from-sas-rd-staff-2/" target="_blank">End year Haiku</a> again!

Yesterday I finished my project, wrote a Haiku to colleagues worldwide to say happy new year, then closed my desktop, said goodbye to colleagues still in office:

> In December my baby born
> 
> my project deliveries followed on
> 
> Now my computers shutdown
> 
> do until(6 Jan 2011) I will be OOO
> 
> Please take blessings from John

Happy New Year!
