Welcome for any comments.

The SGF2011 will be held at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. The interesting thing is that, as far as I know, Caesars Palace in Las Vegas was also the host for SUGI 1978(Jan 30-Feb 1, 1978). looking forward to seeing my SAS gurus in Caesars Palace next year, a place of history.
