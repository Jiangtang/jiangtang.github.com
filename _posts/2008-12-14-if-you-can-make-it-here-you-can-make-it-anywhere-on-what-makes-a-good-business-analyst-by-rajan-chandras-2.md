In the latest post, [_<span class="HeadGiantblack">What Makes a Good Business Analyst?</span>_](http://www.intelligententerprise.com/blog/archives/2008/12/what_makes_a_go.html), Rajan Chandras cites some soft items from  <span class="hpTopStoryBlurb"><em>Forrester&#8217;s Business Analyst Assessment Workbook</em>:<br /> </span> <span class="hpTopStoryBlurb"></span>

  * Ability to think abstractly, identify patterns, and generate ideas and solutions
  * Understanding of when and how to escalate issues or needs
  * Understanding of and ability to delivery the appropriate level of detail needed for each task
  * Interest in exploring and understanding new concepts and topic areas
  * Emotionally invested in the work
  * Ability to learn by shadowing stakeholders
  * Ability to clearly articulate technology in terms stakeholders can understand
  * Understanding of the organizational culture and its impact on processes and projects (this one seems obvious, but the latter phrase is more profound than might seem at first glance)
  * Ability to drive a decision analysis and selection process
  * Ability to recognize patterns in requirements and categorize them appropriately

What&#8217;s more, there are some suggestions by Rajan Chandras himself: <span class="hpTopStoryBlurb"></span>

  * Know the organization&#8217;s external environment: its competitive position, current state of the industry, geographical & social factors, etc.
  * Know the organization&#8217;s internal environment: its financial position, organization culture, IT maturity, etc.
  * Adapt to the needs (your language, dress etc.), but be yourself. Imperfect, yet genuine, is fine; falsity comes through easily, and will destroy your credibility in no time.

<span class="hpTopStoryBlurb">No doubt, no boss can reject such a perfect analyst. But I&#8217;m afraid these standards are suitable for every professionals.</span> <span class="hpTopStoryBlurb">That is to say, they create a model to explain everything. It is too universal to be served as a good filter to select the most proper analysts. She or he may more marketable in any other business line.</span>
