Data Mining in Stock Market? Is it crazy? or is it just a hopeless try? Every mentor in mathematics and finance educates us that the stock market is too chaotic and **sentimental** to use mathematical models. Most of all gift rock scientists are concentrated in the study of interest of rates and fixed income securities. It sounds profitable to use mathematical and statistical models to predict the price of stock, but there are little successfull stories.

I know I might hold some academic doctrines, so I have interest to monitor any effort to try to forecast stock prices using data mining techniques. Some links from a popular data mining blog , [_Data Mining Research_](http://dataminingresearch.blogspot.com/), are listed as follows:
