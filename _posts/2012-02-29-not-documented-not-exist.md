<font size="1">Weeks before I first got the <a href="http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/2012/02/12/column-mode-in-sas-9-3-enhanced-editor/" target="_blank">column edit mode in SAS 9.3 Enhanced Editor</a>. Since had no previous SAS versions in machine, I just checked the <a href="http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/hostwin/63285/HTML/default/viewer.htm#editor_enhanced.htm" target="_blank">online documentation of SAS 9.2</a> in which it’s not mentioned (while documented in <a href="http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/hostwin/63047/HTML/default/viewer.htm#editor_enhanced.htm" target="_blank">SAS 9.3</a>) then I concluded the column mode is an exciting new feature in SAS 9.3: if it is not documented, it doesn’t exist!</font>

<font size="1">Then it turns that I was wrong. My friend <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/venkat-veerisetty/5/33/8b9" target="_blank">Venkat Veerisetty</a> just told me that this feature was available since SAS v8. I also found a machine with SAS v9.2 and it works.</font>

<font size="1">While not-documented-not-exist is obviously an arbitrary assumption regardless of facts, I still hold it somehow when emphasizing the importance of documentation.&#160; <a href="http://blogs.sas.com/content/sasdummy" target="_blank">Chris Hemedinger</a> gave <a href="http://blogs.sas.com/content/sasdummy/2011/03/29/undocumented-features-theres-a-reason-they-are-not-documented/" target="_blank">a reason why there are some undocumented “behaviors” in SAS</a>. It makes sense, while in this case, it would be just happened to be missed in other documents and then newly added in v9.3.</font>
