It is well known that the French writer, author of _The Three Musketeer_, Alexandre Dumas, wrote his master piece of work in different colored papers according to literary genre:

> <font color="#ff0000"><strong>non-fiction on&#160; rose,</strong></font>
> 
> <font color="#0000ff"><strong>fiction on blue,</strong></font>
> 
> <font color="#ffff80"><strong>poetry on yellow</strong></font>

The SAS blog writer, author of _[Statistical Programming with SAS/IML Software](http://support.sas.com/publishing/authors/wicklin.html)_, <a href="http://blogs.sas.com/iml/" target="_blank">Rick Wicklin</a> of SAS Institute,&#160; also leads a strong “color revolution” in SAS blog community:

[<img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="JohariWindow" border="0" alt="JohariWindow" src="http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/JohariWindow_thumb.jpg" width="333" height="330" />](http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/JohariWindow1.jpg)In an interesting personal statement, [_Blogging, Programming, and Johari Windows_](http://blogs.sas.com/iml/index.php?/archives/124-Blogging,-Programming,-and-Johari-Windows.html), Rick summarizes his rich and colorful blogging rhythms according to the above [_Johari window_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window):&#160;&#160; 

  * <font color="#ffff80">Mondays</font>, writes introductory notes (corresponding to the upper right quadrant of Johari window).&#160; 
  * <font color="#bcdee2">Wednesdays</font>, experimental articles on sampling, simulation and other statistical programming topics(lower left quadrant). 
  * <font color="#008000">Fridays</font>, on explorative analysis of data (upper left quadrant). 

So what about the <font color="#ff8080">lower right quadrant</font>? Rick rediscovers and exposes what he once knew. Just suppose that, Rick picks up some codes he wrote before (ten years ago maybe) with big surprise: oh, who on earth wrote such damned clever beautiful codes? He or she must be in his/her aggressive youth. –then Rick wrote them all in blog.

Here I produced a summary table for Rick’s blogging activities (numbers per month per weekday; before July 16, 2011 Beijing time; _next following post would introduce how to use SAS to analyze data from website such as Rick’s blog_):

[<img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="Rick" border="0" alt="Rick" src="http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Rick_thumb.png" width="485" height="433" />](http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Rick.png)&#160;

Key findings:

  * Rick is really a frequent and productive blogger with averagely 0.5 posts per day! 
  * Rick DOES keep his words. Most of the posts are published in <font color="#008000">Friday</font>, <font color="#bcdee2">Wednesday </font>and <font color="#ffff80">Monday</font>(44, 44, 42 posts respectively). 
  * None posted in Saturdays and Sunday. 

Rick began his writing since September&#160; 3. 2010, <font color="#008000">Friday</font>.&#160; Up to July 15. 2011, <font color="#008000">Friday</font>, there are 48 <font color="#008000">Fridays</font>, 46 <font color="#bcdee2">Wednesdays </font>and 46 <font color="#ffff80">Mondays</font>.&#160; Only 10 colored weekdays (4 <font color="#008000">Fridays</font>, 2 <font color="#bcdee2">Wednesdays </font>and 4 <font color="#ffff80">Mondays</font>) passed with no posts and most all them are due to national holidays: 

> 06/09/2010 , <font color="#ffff80">Monday</font>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; : Labor Day   
> 24/11/2010 , <font color="#bcdee2">Wednesday</font>: round Thanksgiving Day   
> 26/11/2010 , <font color="#008000">Friday</font>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; : round Thanksgiving Day   
> 22/12/2010 , <font color="#bcdee2">Wednesday</font>   
> 24/12/2010 , <font color="#008000">Friday</font>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; : Christmas Day   
> 27/12/2010 , <font color="#ffff80">Monday</font>   
> 31/12/2010 , <font color="#008000">Friday</font>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; : New Year’s Day   
> 30/05/2011 , <font color="#ffff80">Monday</font>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; : Memorial Day   
> 10/06/2011 , <font color="#008000">Friday</font>   
> 04/07/2011 , <font color="#ffff80">Monday</font>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; : Independence Day

At least in 4 holidays (most in <font color="#ffff80">Monday</font>), Rick was also active in writing:

> 11/10/2011, <font color="#ffff80">Monday</font>, Columbus Day: _How Do You Reshape a Matrix?_   
> 11/11/2010, Thursday, Veterans Day: _It&#8217;s Here!_   
> 17/01/2011, <font color="#ffff80">Monday</font>, Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.: _On the Flip Side: Exchanging Rows and Columns_   
> 21/02/2011, <font color="#ffff80">Monday</font>, Washington’s Birthday: _How to Build a Vector from Expressions_

Amazing Rick keeps a fixed writing pattern and in next following post, detailed analysis and SAS codes will be presented so you can also keep eyes on the metadata of your favorite bloggers’ writing and may rise a question like:

Hey Rick, what’s up in Jun 10, 2011, Friday?
