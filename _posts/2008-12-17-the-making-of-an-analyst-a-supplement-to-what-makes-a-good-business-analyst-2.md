  <span style="font-family: Arial;">I once commented the entry, <a href="http://www.intelligententerprise.com/blog/archives/2008/12/what_makes_a_go.html"><em><span class="HeadGiantblack">What Makes a Good Business Analyst</span></em></a> by Rajan Chandras, with an easy tone, <em><a href="http://jiangtanghu.blogspot.com/2008/12/if-you-can-make-it-here-you-can-make-it.html">If You Can Make it Here, You Can Make it Anywhere</a></em>. The standards of a good analyst conclude by Rajan, in my opinion, are somewhat of very high bars.</p>

      <span style="font-family: Arial;">In the recent SASCOM Magazine, Ted Cuzzillo published a relatively moderate enty, say, <em><a href="http://www.sas.com/news/sascom/2008q4/feature_analyst.html">The Making of An Analyst</a></em>. This paper is considered the fresh graduates to be an analysts in their first job hunting. </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Yes, there two posts are more compatible than oppositive. Rajan&#8217;s targets are those veteran analysts with years of experience.</span>
