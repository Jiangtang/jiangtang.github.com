<a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/03/29/1966004/book-bargains-abound-at-wake-county.html" target="_blank"><font size="1">This picture</font></a> <font size="1">(by newsobserver.com) took from <a href="http://www.wakegov.com/libraries/about/booksale.htm" target="_blank">Wake County Library Book Fair in North Carolina</a> Fairground where I also went to pick up some books. </font>

<font size="1">I was and still is a big book (almost paper books) fan. But when I was standing among the 450,000 used books in the book fair, I felt depressed and reluctantly had an impression: the paper&#160; books will and should go away in the future.&#160; eBooks will not fade away and they also have the economical, ecological and even <font color="#ff0000">aesthetical</font> advantages.</font>

<font size="1">Books are good(hundred and t<font size="1">housand years ago, our ancestors read books in silk, bamboo, shell, stone, . . .</font>), new paper books are good too. But the massive used books are burdens. I like the smell of ink of paper books but only for the new. The 450, 000 used books only have some recycling values: you can get a bag of books only for only 1 buck in the last exhibition day!</font>

# Digital Life and Personal Data Analysis

<font size="1">eBook is one part of our digital library. We also have eMails, eBills, Tweets . . . and these data are born for analysis: complete, accurate, well formatted while in time(<em>again, analytical advantage!</em>). </font>

<font size="1"><a href="http://www.stephenwolfram.com/" target="_blank">Stephen Wolfram</a>, the founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/" target="_blank">Wolfram Research</a>, posted <a href="http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/" target="_blank">an analysis of his personal emails</a> as above. Thatâ€™s cool and you might know that years ago a writer would transcribe at least two copies of his/her mail, one for sending out and another for archiving (and publishing).</font>
