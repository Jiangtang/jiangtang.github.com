<span style="font-size: small;">Today I tried to install a SAS format viewer, one of </span>[<span style="font-size: small;">my favorite SAS AF utilities</span>](http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/2012/10/02/two-sas-af-utilities-logfilter-and-format-viewer/) <span style="font-size: small;">in a virtual machine, and it came out a bad news and a good news.</span>

<span style="font-size: small;">The bad news is that the </span>[<span style="font-size: small;">website I used to download the SAS Format Viewer (by Frank Poppe)</span>](http://frank-poppe.xs4all.nl/SAS/edit_format.html) <span style="font-size: small;">is no longer accessible(<em>LESSON LEARNED: make an offline copy when you check piece of codes online!</em>).</span>

<span style="font-size: small;">While the good news is, that  a company named </span>[<span style="font-size: small;">BiX</span>](http://bixforsas.com/) <span style="font-size: small;">just released a free version of (yet another) </span>[<span style="font-size: small;">SAS format viewer</span>](http://bixforsas.com/?page_id=5343)<span style="font-size: small;">. I got it tested and it works pretty well, just like Poppe’s version I used.</span>

<span style="font-size: small;">2</span>

<span style="font-size: small;">I like to work with SAS Display Manager (DMS) in Windows where I can get code editor, log window, output window, data explorer, etc at a NOT-TOO-BAD GUI, and I can also implement some productive SAS AF utilities like format viewer and log checker. </span>

<span style="font-size: small;">SAS Enterprise Guide(EG) actually is a much modern IDE for SAS programmers and my favorite AF utilities can be also replaced by some handy EG add-ons. Currently I’m not fully engaged in it for my personal development work because </span>

  * <span style="font-size: small;">it consumes more resource than DMS and usually I can’t stand with it.</span>
  * <span style="font-size: small;">EG also doesn’t support all programming features supported by SAS Base, for example, it doesn’t recognize the clipboard behavior showed up in the following demos:</span>

[<span style="font-size: small;"><img style="background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 3px auto 5px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="EG_clipbrd" alt="EG_clipbrd" src="http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/EG_clipbrd_thumb.png" width="475" height="356" border="0" /></span>](http://www.jiangtanghu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/EG_clipbrd.png)

<span style="font-size: small;">I believe EG will rule the world in the future, and even now, in many sites, it was chosen as the solo interface for SAS programmers.  I understand IT admins will benefit it a lot due to easy implantation, maintenance and control, but for SAS programmers, it’s better to have many options.</span>
