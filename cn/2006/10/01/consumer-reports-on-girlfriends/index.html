                    Consumer_Reports_On_Girlfriends
  </h1>
  
  <pre>     Well it's been almost 20 years since Consumer's Reports reviewed
     girlfriends (CR, Aug 1972).  Since then, styles have changed, new
     features have been introduced, and the market for
     girlfriends has changed substantially.  So we here at CU decided
     another report was needed.

     As in a car or a computer, you should ask yourself what you
     need a girlfriend for before obtaining one.  This will, in large part,
     dictate the final product which you should consider.  Do you want an
     intellectual companion?  A baby factory?  A hiking partner?  Or just
     lots of good, old-fashioned sex?  Identifying your needs is the first,
     and most important, step in selecting a girl- friend.

     The second question which needs to be addressed is, of course,
     how much you are able to spend.  This is largely determined by your
     physical and personal characteristics--if you are good looking, have a
     commanding personality and a good sense of humor, you will have the
     resources to obtain a fancy, high-end model.
     On the other hand, if you are ugly, smell bad, and wear polyester
     clothes, your choices are more limited.  Keep your purchasing power in
     mind when considering your selection.  Although the salesman will tell
     you that a girlfriend can be financed, CU does not recommend this
     practice; due to inflating expectations, the required monetary outlay
     will actually *increase* with time.

     Used vs. New?
     -------------
     A question many girlfriend seekers have to address is whether
     to get a new or a used girlfriend.  The answer to this question will,
     roughly speaking, be determined by your age, as shown in the following
     table:

     Your age          Used or New
     --------               -----------
     1-12 years        (see note A)
     13-16 years      New
     17-21 years      Used, but not used up
     22-35 years      Used heavily
     35-60 years      New (see note B)
     60+                 (see note A)

     Notes: A: Seek psychiatric help!
     B: Only "new" if income &gt; $100,000/year.
     Otherwise, "divorced".

     New girlfriends have the advantage that they have no previous
     bad experiences to project on you, but the disadvantage that they will
     rarely be old enough to open their own checking account. Used
     girlfriends, on the other hand, may be steady, reliable performers,
     with the initial problems worked out, but CU advises that you avoid
     models which have much more than average mileage (2.1 SO's/yr).  Much
     greater than the average may be an indication that the girlfriend was
     a professional.

     Accessories
     -----------
     Often the potential girlfriends you see on the lot or in a
     tavern will be loaded with accessories, as the dealer gets a high
     markup on such items as large bosom, long legs, green eyes, etc. Other
     accessories will only appeal to fringe markets, such as models which
     come pre-equipped with children, or the ability run 10 miles while
     chanting sanskrit.  In such cases you should make a list of
     accessories desired, tolerated, and disliked.  Note that some
     accessories (such as children) can be added later, while others (such
     as a large bosom) must be factory installed.

     The Test Ride
     -------------
     When evaluating a girlfriend, a test ride is essential.  The
     test ride ritual begins with the so-called "pickup line", which can
     range from the simple if dull ("Can I buy you a drink?") to the
     aggressively hip ("dance with me or I'll kill you") to the arcane
     ("You're my Camus comrade, and I want to leap you, Faith!").  CU rates
     as Not Acceptable "Smile, you'll look better."  Once on the test bed,
     evaluate handling, stability, and acceleration.  The two questions you
     want to answer are: how fast, and how far?  Examine the detailing.  Does
     the bosom sag? Does the heater warm adequately, or does she remain
     cool?

     Ordering vs. On-The-Lot
     -----------------------
     Finding the right girlfriend can be a frustrating experience,
     and many potential customers find it hard to get the exact model and
     accessories wanted. In such cases ordering from the factory is an
     option.  Delivery time, however, is from 14 to 16 years (depending on
     the state you live in), and CU questions the usefulness of such a
     practice: if you have access to the baby factory, you should
     reconsider your need for a girlfriend anyway.

     Methodology
     -----------
     Girlfriends were evaluated by a dedicated group of 10 test
     engineers, selected to typify the average seeking population. All
     tests were performed at CU's specially constructed test
     facility, which included a bedroom, kitchen, and living room, and at a
     number of bars and taverns surrounding the facility.  A series of
     seven tests were run, evaluating each product according to the
     following criterion: intelligence, wit, humor, empathy, initiative,
     looks, and performance.

     Results
     -------
     Girlfriends are grouped together in categories by similarity.
     Within each category, variation is not statistically significant.

     Category        Comments

     --------       ---------------------------------------------------
     Goddess:        This is the woman of your dreams.  She comes
     equipped with all the options you want and none of the ones you don't.
     She can argue subtle points of philosophy, give you a stiff game of
     racquetball, understand what you mean even if you don't say it, and
     break a bed.  No mental or physical hang-ups. The drawback is that
     this model is not actually available.

     Goddess-in-law: This model is similar to the goddess, but comes
     with contractual retainers, such as a psychotic ex-husband, a spiteful
     mother, an alcoholic father, and a bratty kid.  This model tends to
     generate grey hairs.

     Ms. Right:      The best all-around choice for most girlfriend
     situations. Has most of the characteristics of the Goddess except
     possibly in the wrong size or hair color.  Other than that, an
     excellent long-term investment.  Availability is extremely limited but
     can occasionally be found with luck.

     Babe:           This is the flashy, fully-loaded variety with all
     the options.  Unfortunately this model lacks cognitive powers and
     empathy. Showy, and suitable for a parade or for impressing your
     friends, but not for your long-term girlfriend needs.

     Friend:         The model with the most empathy.  Caring and kind
     but you wouldn't be caught dead in it.  Availability is poor to fair,
     depending on quality.

     Yeah, Her:      The Ford Escort of girlfriends.  Widely
     available, but useful as a girlfriend only in a pinch, if no others
     are available. Tends to be spiteful or unreliable, or have a dull
     finish.

     Until you find her, we at CU wish you Happy Hunting!
