      <description>前些日子跟Li一起看光盘，歌剧《悲惨世界》第一幕（Les Miserables, 8th October 1995, 10th Anniversday Concert @ Royal Albert Hall。你可以在youku找到）。现在才知道，以前在选秀节目“英国达人”中脱颖而出的苏珊大妈，她唱的_I Dreamed a Dream_就是这剧里的选段:
&amp;#160;
  There was a time when men were kind When their voices were soft And their words inviting There was a time when love was blind And the world was a song And the song was exciting There was a time Then it all went wrong  I dreamed a dream in time gone by When hope was high And life worth living I dreamed that love would never die I dreamed that God would be forgiving Then I was young and unafraid And dreams were made and used and wasted There was no ransom to be paid No song unsung, no wine untasted  But the tigers come at night With their voices soft as thunder As they tear your hope apart And they turn your dream to shame  He slept a summer by my side He filled my days with endless wonder He took my childhood in his stride But he was gone when autumn came  And still I dream he&amp;#8217;ll come to me That we will live the years together But there are dreams that cannot be And there are storms we cannot weather  I had a dream my life would be So different from this hell I&amp;#8217;m living So different now from what it seemed Now life has killed the dream I dreamed   曾经,人们和善有礼 声音轻柔温和 话语亲切动人 曾经,爱情盲目 整个世界仿若一首歌曲 振奋人心 但是,这一切终究改变了  我梦见了往日美梦 那时希望无限, 生活澎湃 我梦见爱情永不消逝 我梦见上帝包容着一切 那时,我是如此年轻而无惧 做着美梦,挥霍着梦想 了无牵挂 我,无歌不唱,无酒不欢  然而老虎(危险)在夜晚潜密而来 伴随着如雷般的低吼 他们将你的希望撕成碎片 他们将你的梦想变成耻辱  整个夏天他在我身旁安睡 他让我的生活充满无尽的惊喜 他轻易地带走我年轻的时光 但秋天来临,他却离去  我依旧梦想着他会回到我身边 梦想着我们快乐度过余生 然而总有难圆的美梦 总有难以避免的风浪  我曾经梦想我的生活 全然不似现在这地狱般的生活 全然不似我曾经想象的 现在,现实扼杀了我往日的梦想 我往日的梦想    &amp;#160;</description>
