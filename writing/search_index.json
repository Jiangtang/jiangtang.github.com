I put it on top because this is the most accessible Iliad I have even read and it’s FREE. Another bonus is the high quality unabridged audiobook. 1.1.1.2 Translated by Samuel Butler, Revised by Gregory Nagy et al. In Center For Hellenic Studies, free The only prose translation in this list. Used in a MOOC course of 1.1.2.1. The reviser Gregory Nagy said this revised translation aims to be as honest as possible to the original Greek text. 1.1.1.3 Translated by Robert Fagles In Amazon. This is arguably the best translation in the market considering the tradeoff of rigorousness and readability. It’s also the only print version I hold. The corresponding audiobook is abridged, unfortunately. This is the only drawback I think of using this version (not the version itself). The other two strong competitive translations are Richmond Lattimore and Robert Fitzgerald. These two versions both have nice unabridged audiobooks. 1.1.1.4 Translated by Caroline Alexander In Amazon. There are dozens of modern translations of Iliad and the reason I single this new translation out is solely because, this is the very first female translation of Homer around the world! Currently I only read a fraction of her translation from one of her books, The War That Killed Achilles. 1.1.2 Video Courses 1.1.2.1 The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours (Hour 1-8 ) In edX, taught by Gregory Nagy of Harvard University.
